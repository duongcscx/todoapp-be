Todo app - BE only


// Readme should always be updated, When you work in large teams its important for others to be able to setup projects 

// What - Is this project about 
// How - to setup and run - Test, Server and Validations like postman
// Where - You can reach out for help in case of issues - Documentation(link etc) or Person 


// JWT should be password/secret protected


// TDD in practice when in projects or Next assignment

// Exception handling in important and passing back right message to users/developer. Stacktrace should not be sent to user or to console .. they should only be logged in logger 

// In real projects when you deploy to dev we generally set logging level to debug/trace but in prodcution debug generate too many logs so we only set it to info/error. This need to be configurable by env so if deploy BE to dev then logging is set to Debug )


// Schema in Joi should be there for request and response both, These will be generated swagger. schema will be visible in swagger as well.
